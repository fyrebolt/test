# how to use
**-MOSAIC** was built for the 2023 Hyphen Hackathon* at Lick-Wilmerding High School by 4 amateur programmers in a time limit of **12 hours**. Every file is published and can be accessed. This exact file was submitted on 09/30/2023 at around 9:00.

Make and account and join the canvas. Use keyboard keys (0-9) to pick a color. 

# info
There were **11** different downloaded drafts of the art canvas code.
1) squares follow cursor, server works
2) forgot, probably a bug
3) drawing mechanic works
4) same as 2
5) same as 2
6) colors worked
7) names are stored as ids
8) first attempt of activity record (typo bug)
9) activity display failure, activity is able to be detected
10) bug where users that joined afterwards could not load user names that joined prior
11) final draft
If you do decide to visit any of the prior canvas's, they are linked to the same server as the current model, please close the tab when using as unexpected bugs may occur.

This project contains all the test files (index, firebasetest) as well, used a different website as a basis. Every page part of the project was written from scratch.
I intended to fork this page into a different repo with a more appropriate name but css made us run out of time.

This is my first major project published under time pressure with completely original code and a original idea with a group of acquaintances.
Thank you @baron, @fufu, and @nyang for collaborating with me. 

This will be forked and unnecessary/prior files will be deleted and archived to be _completely finalized_. <br>
-> update: this has been done! (https://github.com/fyrebolt/mosaic)
